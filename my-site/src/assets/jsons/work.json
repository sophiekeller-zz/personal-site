For my full stack project, I built a tool to support the process of debugging problems that arise during daily payment reconciliations. This project required development of a suite of Ruby on Rails API endpoints, a complex React frontend, and a multitude of MySQL data migrations. After completing this project with time to spare, I focused on improving performance of a few heavy database queries my tool ran, partnering with the Infrastructure team to perform database structure alterations that improved speeds on other highly trafficked pages within the system.

            "text": "For a year, I worked as a full stack developer at a data quality surveillance company called Qualytics. I wore many hats there, creating and maintaining a relational SQL database, writing and testing dozens of RESTful endpoints for the customer-facing site, and building a custom Google Bigquery data pipeline. After trying my hand at developing a data pipeline, I took on a Kafka pipeline that was used multiple places in the codebase, requiring me to understand the productâ€™s tech stack holistically. Working with Kafka also brought exposure to Docker containers and TCP/IP network engineering. I was granted freedom in driving my work, whether it was designing authentication plans or restructuring the database for scalability, shaping me to be an active participant in collaborations. The start-up environment exposed me to a variety of technologies while pushing me to learn on the go, often with little guidance."
